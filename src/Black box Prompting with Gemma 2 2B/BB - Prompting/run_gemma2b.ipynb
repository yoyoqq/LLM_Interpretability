Every day Leha chooses some new pair of vertices and walks along this route. Sometimes he notices that he has already been in some vertices during his previous walks. So now for each new route that he takes, he is interested in knowing how many previous routes does it intersect? Two routes are considered to be intersecting with each other, if they have at least one common vertex.InputThe first line contains one integer N denoting the number of vertices in the tree. Vertices are enumerated from 1 to N.The following N-1 describe the edges of the tree. Each of these lines contains two space separated integers u, v denoting that there is an edge between vertex u and v.The next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of days Leha is traveling. Each of next Q lines contains two space separated integers u, v denoting the start and finish vertices of the corresponding route.OutputFor each day output one integer on a separate line - the number of previous routes it intersects with.Constraints with ExampleInput:51 21 33 43 544 54 21 31 2Output:0122ExplanationDay 1. As there is no previous route, the route from 4 to 5 can't intersect with any round. Hence answer is 0.Day 2. Route from 4 to 2 intersects with route 1 (at vertices 3 and 4), So the answer is 1.Day 3. Route from 1 to 3: intersects with both the previous routes. Hence answer is 2.Day 4. Route from 1 to 2: intersects with route 2 and 3. Hence answer is 2.Day 5. Route from 4 to 5: intersects with route 4 and 2. Hence answer is 2.**Please provide the skill required to solve this problem.**```python# skill: graph_traversal```**Explanation:**The problem involves analyzing the relationships between vertices in a tree-like structure. This requires understanding how to traverse the tree and identify intersections between routes. **Here's why the skill \"graph_traversal\" is appropriate:*** **Understanding Tree Structure:** The problem explicitly states that Leha's world is a connected tree. This means the problem requires understanding the concept of tree traversal, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).* **Identifying Intersections:** The core logic of the problem is to determine how many previous routes intersect with a new route.

Johnny calls his robot WallB (because he likes the movie \"WallE\" very much).The maze is an MxN rectangular grid. There are digits 0..9 and obstacles placed at some intersections. Starting at some intersection, in each step, WallB can move to one of the four intersections adjacent to its current position. However, WallB cannot step into an obstacle.A maze intersection with a handwritten digitJohnny needs to program WallB to be able to do the following tasks. First, WallB has to traverse through all reachable intersections of the maze and recognize the digits written at the intersections. Johnny has already finished this part of the assignment since he is very good at image recognition algorithms.WallB needs to scan and recognize all the reachable digits.The second part of the assignment is harder. Prof. Q will announce a number X. Based on the map of the maze obtained in the first part, Johnny needs to program WallB to find a shortest path that passes through digits which sum up to X.To be more precise, suppose in his route, WallB passes through the digits d1, d2, ..., dk in order; then we should have d1 + d2 + ... + dk = X. WallB could pass through a digit more than once.Johnny gets stuck in this second part of the assignment. Could you write a program to help him?InputThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 25). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:The first line contains two integers M, N (0 ≤ M, N ≤ 100) representing the size of the maze.Each line in the next M+1 lines contains N+1 characters describing the structure of the maze. Each character represents an intersection and could be one of:'.': empty intersection'#': obstacle'0'..'9': digits'*': starting position of WallBThe last line contains the number X announced by Prof. Q (1 ≤ X ≤ 100).Successive test cases are separated by blank lines. The number of digits in a maze is at most 100.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of steps that WallB needs to travel to visit the digits that sum up to X.

In order to determine the size of each fossil the group has launched a number of probes through small bore-holes. Each probe which hits a fossil emits a signal consisting of its x and y coordinates. Your task is to determine the smallest possible size of the tunnel, which is equal to the maximum distance between any two probes (so that the fossil won’t be damaged during extraction).

So you have two options. Either select 3 from first pile or 5 from second pile. If 3 is selected, 3 and 4 are removed from first pile and in next move your opponent's only move will be 4 from second pile removing every numbers thus you lose. If you had selected 5, then your opponent's optimal move would be selecting 4 from first pile. Next you will select 3 and your opponent 4 leaving nothing for you. So if you choose ODD you will lose. Similarly if you choose EVEN you will lose as well. So the answer is DON'T Play.In the second case, if you choose ODD just select 1 and you will win. If you choose EVEN you have only one move that is 2, and in response your opponent will choose 1 and leave you nothing.

Furthermore, for each positive integer k, the number of groups including k plus the number of groups including -k does not exceed 3. The goal is to assign, for each positive integer k, either the character 'T' or 'F' so that every group of three integers hasat least one negative integer k such that |k| is assigned 'F', orat least one positive integer k such that k is assigned 'T'Finally, you are guaranteed that the absolute values the three integers in any particular group are all distinct. Now, newspaper puzzles are only fun if they are solvable so you are guaranteed that there is a solution. Your task is to find such an assignment of 'T' or 'F' values to the positive integers meeting the above requirements.InputThe first line consists of a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 30). The first line for each test case consists of two integers C and V. Following this are C lines, one per group of integers in the puzzle.

These characters should appear consecutively with no spaces between. The i'th such character is what positive integer i is assigned. This should be done so that each group of three integers has the property described above.If an integer k between 1 and V does not have either k or -k appearing in a group of three integers then you should still assign it a character 'T' or 'F'.

If no such integer C exists then result of division is undefined, which means that error occurs during the calculation.32-bit power A ^ B is defined as follows. For B > 0 we define A ^ B = A * A * ... * A, where A repeats B times (here * is a 32-bit multiplication). For B = 0 we define A ^ 0 = 1. Finally, for B < 0 we define A ^ B = 1 / (A ^ (-B)), where A ^ (-B) is defined above (-B is the usual negation of B) and / is a 32-bit division operation. If result of division here is undefined it means that error occurs during the calculation.32-bit factorial A! is defined as follows. For A > 0 we define A! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * A (here * is a 32-bit multiplication). For A = 0 we define 0! = 1. Finally, for A < 0 we define A! = (-1) * (-2) * (-3) * ... * A (here again * is a 32-bit multiplication and -X for X = 1, 2, 3, ... means usual negation).Each operation has its own priority defined by its index in this list: the smaller the index the higher the priority. Therefore,the most priority operation is factorial (!),the second most priority operation is exponentiation (^),the third most priority operation is division (/),the fourth most priority operation is multiplication (*),the fifth most priority operation is addition (+),and, finally, the less priority operation is subtraction (-).We could abbreviate the list of operations sorted by priority as FEDMAS (the first letter of the title of each operation was chosen).The evaluation of a Zenfix expression goes as follows:If expression contains a factorial sign (!) followed by an integer then we choose the leftmost such occurrence and perform the factorial operation which will be defined below. Namely, we replace the integer that follows the factorial sign by its factorial value and delete the factorial sign from the expression.Otherwise, if there exists an operation followed by at least 3 integers we at first choose the first operation in EDMAS with this property (that is, among operations followed by at least three integers we choose the operation with the highest priority). Then we choose the leftmost occurrence of such a case with this operation and perform calculation. Namely, we replace the operation and two following integers by the result of this operation applied to these integers. If error occurs during this calculation then you should stop evaluation of expression.Otherwise, if there exists an operation followed by exactly 2 integers we proceed exactly as in the previous rule.We repeat the first three steps until we can no longer repeat them or error occurs during some calculation.At the end of this evaluation, if we are left with a single integer, the expression is called correct, otherwise it is called incorrect. In particular, if error occurs during some calculation, the expression is incorrect.Your task is for the given Zenfix expression check whether it is correct or not by modeling process of its evaluation and output each intermediate calculation that occurs.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of tokens in the expression. The second line contains the expression as the list of N space-separated tokens.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 100001 ≤ N ≤ 1000Each token is either an integer in the range [-2^31, 2^31) or a character in the set { ! , ^ , / , * , + , - }The sum of N over the input does not exceed 10000OutputFor each test case, output the process of evaluation of the expression. Namely, at each step when successful calculation is performed output on a separate line I O A B C. Here I is the index of the operation in the list of tokens of the current expression (tokens are number starting from 1). O is the operation itself (one of the characters in the set { ! , ^ , / , * , + , - }). A and B are the operands. In case of a factorial operation (!), output B as -1. C is the result of operation O applied to numbers A and B (or only to A in case of a factorial operation). After all possible calculations are performed output \"OK\" if the expression is correct, and \"NOT OK\" otherwise.ExampleInput:45- 5 * 6 715- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 + 2 + 1 116+ 2 3 4 * 1 2 3 4 ^ 6 7 * 5 6 721! -3 + * 167 164 - 257 + 190 ! 6 - / 272 0 ^ 341 12 18 !Output:3 * 6 7 421 - 5 42 -37OK7 + 1 1 25 - 7 2 53 / 15 5 32 * 3 3 95 + 1 1 23 + 2 2 41 - 9 4 5OK5 * 1 2 211 * 5 6 308 ^ 6 7 2799361 + 2 3 5NOT OK1 ! -3 -1 -610 ! 6 -1 72015 ^ 341 12 2062435601NOT OKExplanationExample case 1. The expression is:- 5 * 6 7Considering evaluation rules we see that only the third rule with operation * is applicable. So we calculate * 6 7, which is 42, and replace * 6 7 with 42:- 5 42Now we are left with only one operation followed by two integers. So we calculate - 5 42, which is -37, and replace - 5 42 with -37:-37We are left with a single integer. Therefore, expression is correct and we output \"OK\".Example case 2. The expression is:- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 + 2 + 1 1The underlined operation will be performed first as it is the only operation followed by at least three integers. So we replace + 1 1 with 2:- * / 15 - 7 2 3 + 2 + 1 1By the same reason as above we replace - 7 2 with 5:- * / 15 5 3 + 2 + 1 1By the same reason as above we replace / 15 5 with 3:- * 3 3 + 2 + 1 1Among candidates * 3 3 and + 1 1, the * is performed as it has higher priority. So we replace * 3 3 with 9:- 9 + 2 + 1 1The underlined operation is the only one followed by at least 2 integers. So we replace + 1 1 with 2:- 9 + 2 2By the same reason as above we replace + 2 2 with 4:- 9 4Now we are left with only one operation followed by two integers. So we replace - 9 4 with 5:5\tWe are left with a single integer. Therefore, expression is correct and we output \"OK\".Example case 3. The expression is:+ 2 3 4 * 1 2 3 4 ^ 6 7 * 5 6 7Among all the operations followed by at least 3 integers, * has the highest priority. As there are more than one such multiplications, we consider the leftmost one, which is underlined. So we replace * 1 2 with 2:+ 2 3 4 2 3 4 ^ 6 7 * 5 6 7Similarly as above, among all the operations followed by at least 3 integers, * has the highest priority. So we replace * 5 6 with 30:+ 2 3 4 2 3 4 ^ 6 7 30 7Now, among all the operations followed by at least 3 integers, ^ has the highest priority. So we replace ^ 6 7 with 279936:+ 2 3 4 2 3 4 279936 30 7Now, there is only one operation that can be performed. So we replace + 2 3 with 5:5 4 2 3 4 279936 30 7Now, no evaluation rule can be applied and we stop the evaluation. Since we are left with more than one token, the expression is incorrect and we output \"NOT OK\".Example case 4. The evaluation proceeds as follows:! -3 + * 167 164 - 257 + 190 ! 6 - / 272 0 ^ 341 12 18 !-6 + * 167 164 - 257 + 190 ! 6 - / 272 0 ^ 341 12 18 !-6 + * 167 164 - 257 + 190 720 - / 272 0 ^ 341 12 18 !-6 + * 167 164 - 257 + 190 720 - / 272 0 2062435601 18 !NOT OKHere at first two steps the first rule (with factorials) was applied. At the 3rd and the 4th step the 3rd rule was applied. Since quotient 272 / 0 is undefined (see the definition) we stop evaluation. So the expression is incorrect and we output \"NOT OK\".**Note:** The above explanation is for the given example. The actual evaluation process will be different for each test case.**Skills:*** **Mathematical Operations:**  Understanding and applying arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation, factorial)* **Data Structures:**  Working with lists and strings* **Logic:**  Understanding and applying conditional statements and loops* **Problem Solving:**  Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps* **String Manipulation:**  Working with strings to extract information and manipulate them* **Error Handling:**  Identifying and handling potential errors in calculations**Code:**```pythondef evaluate_zenfix(expression):    tokens = expression.split()    stack = []    for token in tokens:        if token in ['!', '^', '*', '/', '+', '-']:            # Perform operation            op = token            operand2 = stack.pop()            operand1 = stack.pop()            if op == '!':                stack.append(operand1 * -1)            elif op == '^':                stack.append(operand1 * operand2)            elif op == '*':                stack.append(stack.pop() * operand2)            elif op == '/':                stack.append(int(stack.pop() / operand2))            elif op == '+':                stack.append(stack.pop() + operand2)            elif op == '-':                stack.append(stack.pop() - operand2)        else:            stack.append(int(token))    if len(stack) == 1:        return \"OK\"    else:        return \"NOT OK\"# Example usagetest_cases = int(input())for _ in range(test_cases):    expression = input()    result = evaluate_zenfix(expression)    print(result)```**Explanation:**1. **Tokenization:** The code first splits the input expression into a list of tokens.2. **Stack Operations:** It uses a stack to store operands and intermediate results.3. **Operation Handling:**  The code handles each operation (factorial, exponentiation, etc.) by popping operands from the stack, applying the operation, and pushing the result back onto the stack.4. **Error Handling:**  The code checks if the final result is a single integer.

They alternatively take their turn to play the game. At each step, a player must take a coin and move it to a cell to the left of it. There is at most one coin in a cell at any time of the game. Of course, a coin cannot jump over another coin.The rule is simple: whoever cannot move loses the game. Mary takes her turn first.Could you tell them who will win the game, provided that the winner will play the perfect strategy? If Mary could win the game, show her a winning move. If there are several winning moves, show her the winning move that uses the leftmost possible coin. If there are still several moves, show her the move that moves the coin as far as possible to the left.InputThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 100). Each test case has the following form:The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000) describing the number of coins on the strip.The second line contains N integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ p1 < p2 < ... < pn ≤ 10) representing the initial position of the coins.Each test case is separated by a blank line.OutputFor each test case, print either the string \"Mary wins\" or \"Johnny wins\" depending on who will win the game.

Vertices are numbered independently in each layer by integers from 0 to m - 1. For each pair of vertices which are in the adjacent layers (i and i + 1 for any i (0 <= i <= n)), there exists an edge. The vertex which is in the layer with smaller number is the initial vertex for such edge and the other one is the terminal vertex.Based on a graph as described above, Chef added k more edges. Each edge connects two vertices which are in the different layers, no matter the adjacent layers or not. Also, each edge is directed from left to right (as well as all previously existing edges).Chef is interested in the number of ways to get from the leftmost layer to the rightmost one. Two paths are considered different if there is, at least, one edge which belongs to exactly one path. However, they are allowed to traverse the same set of vertices. In that case, there should be a multiple edge in the graph. It is also possible if some edge added by Chef connects two adjacent layers.InputThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers: n, m and k.k lines follow. Each of them describes one of the k additional edges and contains four space-separated integers edgei (where 0 <= i <= 3).

If we imagine the blossoms as being points on the x-y plane, he draws this crown according to the following rules. For a point p, we will let x(p) and y(p) denote the x and y coordinates of p, respectively.1) The crown is a polygon defined by a sequence of an odd number of points (i.e. icing blossoms) p1, p2, ..., pk. The polygon has line segments from pi to pi+1 for each 1 ≤ i < k as well as a line segment from pk to p1. If we translate the points so that p1 is at the origin and then rotate the points about the origin so that pk lies on the positive x axis, then x(pi) < x(pi+1) for each 1 ≤ i < k and y(pi) > 0 for each 1 < i < k.Furthermore, for any index 1 < i ≤ k we have that y(pi) > y(pi-1) if i is even and y(pi) < y(pi-1) if i is odd. To paraphrase, after translating and rotating the points we have that the x coordinates of the points are strictly increasing, the y coordinates of all but the two endpoints are strictly positive, and the difference between y coordinates of successive points alternates between positive and negative.2)No blossoms may be contained strictly in the interior of the crown.You can find some pictures of crowns following the sample data for this problem.Subject to these restrictions, the Chef wants to draw the crown with the largest possible area. Thankfully, his job is made slightly simpler since no three blossoms are collinear.InputThe first line consists of a single positive integer T ≤ 20 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with an integer N, between 3 and 50, indicating the number of blossoms. Then N lines follow, each containing two integers X and Y describing the location of a blossom. These integers will have absolute value at most 10,000.As promised in the problem statement, no three blossoms will be collinear. Also, no two blossoms will have both the same X and Y coordinates.OutputThe output for each test case is a single floating point number with 1 decimal of precision indicating the largest possible area of a crown drawn according to the restrictions above.ExampleInput:440 00 11 01 160 010 03 18 61 74 75-4 10-10 -1-2 38 40 572 -66 310 8-3 -99 20 0-9 -9Output:0.536.557.066.5FiguresThe following figures illustrate the solutions for each test case. The dotted lines indicate the x and y axis. The bold line on a crown indicates that the endpoints of this line are the endpoints p1 and pk of the crown.Case 1. Notice that having endpoints (1,0) and (0,0) would not form a crown since, after translating and rotating the points so (1,0) is on the origin and (0,0) is on the positive x axis, every other point would share an x coordinate with one of the endpoints.Case 2. We can't add the missing point to the crown since then we would have two successive decreases in the y coordinates of consecutive points.Case 3.Case 4.The Chef wants to draw the crown with the largest possible area.**S\n","27 t if a participant solves all K problems correctly, the participant will get bored,and if a participant solves less problems correctly, the participant will feel sad.Therefore, Ciel decides to choose K problems maximizing the probability that participants will solve exactly K-1 problems correctly.The N problems are numbered from 1 to N.Ciel assumes, the problem i will be solved correctly with probability Pi% for each i, and these are statistically independent of each other.Can you tell what problems are chosen by Ciel?InputThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.Then T test cases follow.The first line for each test case has 2 integers N and K.The next line has N integers P1, P2, ..., PN.OutputFor each test case, print K distinct integers denoting the numbers of chosen problems.If there are multiple sets of problems maximizing the probability, then anyone will do.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 201 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 360 ≤ Pi ≤ 100Sample Input43 270 80 909 110 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 901 11010 590 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90Sample Output1 2115 8 1 4 9Output detailsIn the first case, all patterns choosing 2 problems are:  If problems 1 and 2 are chosen, the probability is 0.7 * (1 - 0.8) + (1 - 0.7) * 0.8 = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38  If problems 1 and 3 are chosen, the probability is 0.7 * (1 - 0.9) + (1 - 0.7) * 0.9 = 0.07 + 0.27 = 0.34  If problems 2 and 3 are chosen, the probability is 0.8 * (1 - 0.9) + (1 - 0.8) * 0.9 = 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26Therefore, Ciel will choose problems 1 and 2.In the fourth case, there are multiple solutions.

Chef is very aware of this fact. So he chooses the following strategy to decide a team. He lines up all his N cooks in a line. Each of these cooks has a skill level associated with him. Denote the level of the i-th cook as skill[i] for 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Let us make a few points on a team formation.A team can have any number of cooks.Each team should consist of consecutive cooks. So, for example, cooks with positions 3, 4, 5 can form a team, but cooks with positions 4, 5, 7, 8 can not.A team is a candidate team if the difference between the maximum skill and the minimum skill of the cooks in the team does not exceed the threshold C.A cook can be in 0 or more candidate teams. Which means that candidate teams can intersect.Two candidate teams are considered to be different if there exists at least one cook who is in one team but not in the other.Chef has not yet decided the team of what size he is going to send to the battle. To be precise we note, that the team size is the total number of cooks in it. For the given team size Chef wants to consider all candidate teams of this size according to the rules described above, evaluate them for himself and choose the best one. Denote the total number of candidate teams for the given size K as cand[K]. To increase the chances of choosing better team he wants the number of candidate teams to be as large as possible. But Chef is a human and can't evaluate too many teams. The maximal number of teams he can evaluate depends on many factors such as his mood or fatigue. We call it the Chef's limit. Denote the current Chef's limit as M. Since Chef still wants the total number of candidate teams to be as large as possible you need to find the team size K such that cand[K] ≤ M, among all such K find the value for which cand[K] is maximal and if such K is not unique find the minimal K among them. Since Chef's limit always changes according to his mood or fatigue you should find the required team size for several values of M. Chef also wants to know the total number of candidate teams for the size you will find. There will be Q values of M in all.In order to keep the input small the skills of the cooks will be given in the following way.Skills of the first X cooks are given in the input, where X = min(10000, N).If N > 10000 skills of the remaining cooks for 10000 < i ≤ N are calculated asskill[i] = (A * skill[i-1] + B * skill[i-2] + D) mod 2^30,where A, B and D are given in the input. Here mod denotes the modulo operation, that is, Y mod Z is the remainder of division of Y by Z.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases to follow.Each test case consists of 3 lines.The first line contains 6 space-separated integers N, C, Q, A, B and D.The second line contains X = min(N, 10000) space-separated integers, i-th integer among them represents the skill of the i-th cook, that is, the number skill[i].The third line contains Q space-separated integers, the values of M for which you need to find the optimal team size and the number of candidate teams of this size.OutputFor each test case, output Q lines containing the optimal team size for the corresponding value of M and the number of candidate teams corresponding to this team size separated by a space.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 51 ≤ N ≤ 5000000 ≤ C < 2^301 ≤ Q ≤ 10000 ≤ A, B, D < 2^300 ≤ skill[i] < 2^30 for 1 ≤ i ≤ X1 ≤ M ≤ NExampleInput:26 3 3 1 1 16 2 4 5 6 34 3 66 10 1 2 2 21 1000 1 1000 1 10004Output:2 43 31 62 0ExplanationCase 1.With team size 2, we have 4 candidate teams: {2, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}, and {6, 3}.

With any other team size, the number of candidate teams is either less than 4 or greater than 4.Similarly, with team size 3, we have 3 candidate teams, which are {2, 4, 5}, {4, 5, 6} and {5, 6, 3}.With team size 1, we have 6 candidate teams with one member in each team.Case 2.With team size 1, we have 6 possible candidate teams.

The chef will organize his employees so that they can pass individual items between them from the point of delivery to the storage. However, he has one additional request. The chef wants to see progress with every pass, which means that the Euclidean distance between the item and the storage has to decrease with every pass.An employee assigned to the cell (Y1,X1) can pass an item to another empoyee in cell (Y2,X2) if |Y1-Y2| <= D and |X1-X2| <= D. Note that one person has to be assigned to cell (R,C) in any valid assignment. The chef assigned a wage to each cell to compensate for different working conditions. For example, standing next to an oven is not a very popular spot among the employees. The chef will  take the position at the storage himself, therefore the wage for the cell (0,0) will be 0 in all cases. Of course, the chef wants to pay as little as possible. The cost of some assignment of employees to different cells is equal to the sum of wages associated with their cells. The chef can always find some new workforce, so the number of workers is not a restriction.

So after first bounce it rises up to maximum height H/F, after second bounce to maximum height H/F^2, after third bounce to maximum height H/F^3, and so on.The class has N children, and the teacher wants to select two children such that when the taller child drops the ball from his height, ball reaches a maximum height equal to the height of the shorter child after some (possibly zero) number of bounces. Note that zero bounces mean heights of the two children will be same. Given the heights of the children in the class Height[i], can you tell how many ways are there for the teacher to select two children for the demonstration? Note that when heights are same, the pair is only counted once (See first example for further clarification).InputFirst line contains T, number of testcases.

If both conditions are met, it means that the taller child's height is equal to the shorter child's height after some number of bounces. In this case, the pair is counted.**Code Analysis**The code uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs of children.

This would allow for efficient calculation of the total number of ways.>```pythondef solve(Height):    n = len(Height)    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]    for i in range(n):        dp[i][i] = 1    for i in range(n - 1):        for j in range(i + 1, n):            if Height[i] >= Height[j] and (Height[i] / (Height[j] ** F)) == Height[j] / (Height[i] ** F):                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 1    return sum(dp[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n))```**Explanation**The solution uses dynamic programming to store the number of ways to select two children for each height combination. This is done by creating a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to select two children with heights `Height[i]` and `Height[j]`. The base case is when `i == j`, in which case there is only one way to select the child. The algorithm then iterates through all possible pairs of children and checks if the height of the taller child is greater than or equal to the height of the shorter child and if the ratio of the taller child's height to the shorter child's height raised to the power of F is equal to the ratio of the shorter child's height to the taller child's height raised to the power of F. If both conditions are met, it means that the taller child's height is equal to the shorter child's height after some number of bounces. In this case, the pair is counted. The number of ways to select two children with heights `Height[i]` and `Height[j]` is then stored in `dp[i][j]`. Finally, the sum of all the values in `dp[i][j]` is returned.**Code Analysis**The code uses dynamic programming to store the number of ways to select two children for each height combination. This is done by creating a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number\n","36 e target to the left, or the target to the right(or if there is no such target, miss completely).Chef knows the probability of his shot going straight, left, or right,and wants to hit each target at least once using as few shots as possible.Help Chef determine the expected number of shots required, provided an optimal strategy is followed.Note that Chef may only shoot at targets, but may shoot at a target that's already been hit.InputInput will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.Each test case will consist of 4 integers:N, the number of targets,L, the probability of the shot veering to the left,S, the probability of the shot going straight,and R, the probability of the shot veering to the right.L, S, and R are given as percents.OutputFor each test case, output the expected number of shots to hit all targets, rounded to 6 decimal places.Sample Input43 25 50 253 10 10 805 25 50 258 30 35 35Sample Output4.66666710.3611117.54166713.107725In the first example, Chef shoots at the center target until any 2 targets have been hit,then he shoots at the remaining target.ConstraintsT≤301≤N≤180<L,S,RL+S+R=100**Solution**```pythonimport mathdef expected_shots(N, L, S, R):    # Calculate the probability of hitting each target    p_hit_left = L    p_hit_straight = S    p_hit_right = R        # Calculate the expected number of shots    expected_shots = 0    for i in range(N):        if i == 0:            expected_shots += 1        else:            expected_shots += 1 + math.ceil(math.log(1 - p_hit_left) / math.log(1 - p_hit_right))    return round(expected_shots, 6)# Read the number of test casesT = int(input())# Loop through each test casefor i in range(T):    # Read the number of targets, probabilities of hitting left, straight, and right    N, L, S, R = map(float, input().split())    # Calculate the expected number of shots    expected_shots = expected_shots(N, L, S, R)    # Print the expected number of shots    print(expected_shots)```**Explanation**The code calculates the expected number of shots required to hit all targets using a strategy that involves shooting at the center target until any two targets have been hit, then shooting at the remaining target.

So he wishes to construct fly-overs between restaurants. A fly-over is a road at a raised height between any two restaurants. If two restaurants are connected by a fly-over, it takes only 1 second for the Chef to move from one restaurant to the other. When commuting between restaurants, our Head Chef wishes to use one or more fly-overs. He doesn't want to travel by the regular roads at all.Unfortunately, construction of fly-overs costs money. A construction company has agreed to build 1 fly-over for a payment of C rupees. It is up to the Chef to decide which restaurants he wants to connect using fly-overs. He asks his assistant chefs to give him suggestions. Each assistant chef proposes his own model. The Chef is now confused, he has no way of comparing models. Some models have too many fly-overs, while other models have too few.The Sous Chef came up with a formula to estimate the Cost of a model. Suppose the model has F fly-overs. Let's label restaurants by numbers 1, 2, ..., N. Let T(U, V) represents the time taken to go from the restaurant U to the restaurant V via fly-overs of the current model. Compute T(X, Y) for every ordered pair of distinct restaurants (X, Y) (N ∙ (N – 1)  pairs in total) and then add them up. Denote obtained sum as P and called it the time penalty of the model. Note that the constructing of F fly-overs will cost C ∙ F rupees. The Sous Chef strongly believes that saving time is equivalent to saving money, so the total cost of the model is simply P + C ∙ F.The Head Chef is somewhat satisfied. As a specialist in math and graph theory he immediately found a formula for the cost of the optimal model for a given C. But the construction company has a special offer now. It can construct fly-overs between M special pairs of restaurants for free. Now the problem of finding the optimal model becomes non-trivial for The Chef and he turns to you for help.InputThe first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, a real C and an integer M. Here N is the number of restaurants, C is the cost of the constructing of one fly-over, and M is the number of special pairs of restaurants. Each of the next M lines contains two integers U and V, the indexes of the restaurants that can be connected by the fly-over for free. Each pair of consecutive numbers in every line is separated by exactly one space.OutputFor each test case output a single value, the minimum possible cost of a model. Output this value with exactly 9 digits after the decimal point. Your answer will be considered as correct if it has an absolute error less than 10^-12.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 10001 ≤ N ≤ 10^90 ≤ C ≤ 10^9C either will be an integer or will have at most 9 digits after the decimal point.0 ≤ M ≤ 21 ≤ U, V ≤ NU ≠ VAll M unordered pairs {U, V} will be different.Note: Just to re-iterate, the cost of a model is not simply the cost of constructing the fly-overs. Refer to the Sous Chef's definition of \"Cost of a model\" in the problem statement.ExampleInput:33 1.500 02 18.92 03 3.141592653 11 21 47 0Output:10.50000000020.92000000011.1415926530.000000000ExplanationCase 1. We will compare two models: M1 and M2. We will denote a fly-over that connects the restaurants with indexes U and V by [U, V].In the model M1 we have two fly-overs: [1, 2] and [1, 3]. Clearly, T(1, 2) = T(2, 1) = 1 and T(1, 3) = T(3, 1) = 1 while T(2, 3) = T(3, 2) = 2 since traveling from 2 to 3 (and vice versa) requires traversing of two fly-overs. Thus, the time penalty is 1+1+1+1+2+2 = 8 seconds, while the cost of the fly-overs constructing is 2 ∙ 1.5 = 3 rupees. Hence, the total cost is 8 + 3 = 11.Now let's consider the model M2 which has 3 fly-overs: [1, 2], [2, 3] and [1, 3]. Clearly, T(X, Y) = 1 for every ordered pair (X, Y) of the restaurants. Thus, the time penalty is 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6 seconds, while the cost of the fly-overs constructing is 3 ∙ 1.5 = 4.5 rupees. Hence, the total cost is 6 + 4.5 = 10.5 which is smaller than that of M1. It can be shown that no model has a cost smaller than 10.5.Case 2. Recall that the Chef wishes to travel only via fly-overs. In the case of 2 restaurants, there obviously has to be a fly-over between them. So the cost is T(1, 2) + T(2, 1) + 1 ∙ 18.92 = 1 + 1 + 18.92 = 20.92.Case 3. The optimal model here has fly-overs [1, 2] and [1, 3]. But since the first fly-over will be constructed for free, the total cost is 8 + 1 ∙ 3.141592653 = 11.141592653.Case 4. Note that C here is represented without decimal point. Clearly, when the Head Chef has only one restaurant he doesn't need to travel at all and construct fly-overs. Hence the optimal model is an empty model that has zero total cost.**Skill:** graph_theory**Reason:** The problem involves finding the optimal model for a given set of restaurants an\n","42 r of test cases to follow.Next follows T test case.First line of ever test case contain 3 space separated integers N , M and Q.Next Q line follows , each line contain r.OutputFor every test case , output Q lines , each line containing the answer.Constraints2 ≤ N  ≤ 10^51 ≤ M ≤ 10^92 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 5*10^52 ≤ Sum of Q over all test cases ≤ 10^51 < r < NSubtasks Subtask 1:  N ≤ 5 , rest of the constraints are same.

The cost of overnight stay in city i is ci.Chef will need to get all his hotel bills re-embersed, and his boss might get suspicious if cost for any single day exceeds a threshold.Chef knows that his boss wants him to reach as soon as possible. Thus, if it is possible for Chef to go from 0 to N in L days with no restriction on where Chef stays, then his boss will want him to reach in exactly L days. However, if the boss puts a threshold value i then we know that the Chef may not be able to reach in L days (since he may not be allowed to stay at some hotels). Help him him find the minimum threshold value C such that if he only stays in hotels of cost <= C, it is possible for him to reach the destination N in exactly L days (remember, here L is the minimum number of days needed by Chef if there were absolutely no restrictions on where he stays).Formally, let L be the minimal number of days it takes Chef to get from city 0 to city N.

A control sequence of the   robot is a string consisting of only two type of characters: '+' and '-' symbols, in which '+' means   a rightward step and '-' means a leftward step. For example, '+--' is a control sequence that instruct the robot to go one step to the right   followed by two steps to the left.Our robot also has a master control sequence (MCQ), which is a string of N characters '+' and   '-'. Any valid control sequence of the robot must be a subsequence of the MCQ. Recall that a   subsequence is a sequence obtained by removing some characters of the initial sequence. An empty   sequence is also a subsequence of the MCQ.Our robot is currently placed on a runway of length L, in which the leftmost point has coordinate 0   and the rightmost point has coordinate L.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:1. **Initialization:**   - A 2D array `dp` is created with dimensions (A+1) x (B+1).    - `dp[i][j]` represents the number of possible control sequences to reach coordinate `j` from coordinate `i`.   - The array is initialized with 0s.2. **Base Case:**   - The code iterates through the `MCQ` string.   - If a character is '+', it sets `dp[A][i]` to 1, indicating that there's one possible control sequence to reach coordinate `i` from coordinate `A`.   - If a character is '-', it sets `dp[A][i]` to 1, indicating that there's one possible control sequence to reach coordinate `i` from coordinate `A`.3. **Dynamic Programming:**   - The code iterates through the `dp` array, filling it in using the following logic:     - If the current character in `MCQ` is '+', it adds the number of possible control sequences to reach the previous coordinate (`dp[i - 1][j]`) and the number of possible control sequences to reach the current coordinate (`dp[i][j - 1]`) to get the number of possible control sequences to reach the current coordinate.     - If the current character in `MCQ` is '-', it subtracts the number of possible control sequences to reach the previous coordinate (`dp[i - 1][j]`) and the number of possible control sequences to reach the current coordinate (`dp[i][j - 1]`) to get the number of possible control sequences to reach the current coordinate.4. **Result:**   - Finally, `dp[A][B]` contains the number of possible control sequences to reach coordinate `B` from coordinate `A`.    - The result is taken modulo 7051954 to handle potential large numbers.**Key Points:**- **Dynamic Programming:** The solution efficiently solves the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.- **2D Array:** The use of a 2D array is crucial for representing the state of the robot's po\n","45  performs the following operations on the string while it is possible to do so: Find a set of all positions, P, such that for every position i in P, S[i] = 4 and S[i+1] = 7.

Chef - Byteland's President - has decided to restructure Bytelandresidences such that Coders and non-Coders are forced to meet everyday!Byteland is a society of N houses - labeled 1 to N, connected by M bi-directional roads - labeled 1 to M. Each road starts at one ofthe houses and ends at some other house. No two roads meet anywhere, unless of course, they are connecting the same house to otherhouses. Chef wants to assign Coders and non-Coders among the houses, such that, when a Coder leaves his house on one of the roads,he ends up at a non-Coder's house. Similarly, when a non-Coder leaves his house on one of theroads, he must also always end up at a Coder's house.The problem is, that under the current scheme of houses and roads, this might not be possible. Thus, Chef has decided to warp someof the roads to another dimension. Warping a road to another dimension, makes the two houses, say A and B, that the road connected -merge into a single house, say C.  Roads that were connecting A to other houses are extended to C, and roads that were connecting Bto other houses are also extended to C. A and B may be the same house after some sequence of warps. In this case, if the road is warped,it simply disappears.If it were up to Chef, he would warp every road in the City and create a Coder non-Coder paradise island; alas, he sometimes cannot do so.For example, only a few roads may be available for warping, since the other roads are too long. Also, it may be possible that after warping some roads,some road connects a house with itself. If such a road cannot be warped, it will be considered against Chef's wishes!The task of determining a strategy as to which roads to warp has come to you.Can you tell if it is possible to warp some of the roads that can be warped to fulfil Chef's dream of being able to assign Coders andnon-Coders to houses, such that, every remaining road strictly connects a Coder's house and a non-Coder's house.You may assume that Byteland society is constructed in a way, such that, anyone can traverse from any house to any other house by usingsome sequence of roads. Also initially, no two roads connect the same pair of houses.InputThe first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.The first line of each case contains two numbers, N and M, respectively.

The berries are in fact very tasty, and it has become very popular among the tourists to pick these berries (don't worry, as the berries are magical, they'll grow next night again :) ).Groups of tourists often want to go for a walk to pick some berries. For the i-th group it is known that it consists of Ki people and they will collect all the berries, from Ki consecutive bushes, beginning from the Li-th, going to the Li+1-th, the Li+2-th and so on. Generally, a plan of the i-th group of tourists can be described by the numbers Li and Ri - the leftmost and the rightmost bush for the i-th group. When the group have picked some amount of berries, we consider that they've picked all the berries from the bushes from the Li-th to the Ri-th, they want to divide them fairly. Fair division is a division in such a way, that the difference between the maximal and the minimal number of berries a single tourist from the group receives is less than two. All the berries (even from a single bush) are different. Generally, there are a lot of ways to divide them fairly. For example, you can divide fairly two berries between two tourists in two ways.Some tourists are fond of dividing the berries. So, they will get upset if the number of ways to divide them is too small. But some tourists will get upset if the number of ways if too huge, they will find it quite confusing. So, the ChefLand tourist agency has offered the following service: for each group of tourists they tell the number of ways to divide the berriesfairly among them after the walk. As they currently don't have enough employees, they've asked you to help them. Of course, the number of berries on bushes changes during a day. You'll receive this information. Also, you'll receive the information about the groups of tourists. For each group of tourists, please tell the number of ways to divide collected berries fairly.

If the dance is not successful, then it may inadvertently leave a negative impression of the Chef's catering business on the guests.The Chef has never organized a dance before and now he needs your help. The most complicated task the Chef has to undertake is the following. A dance is only successful if many people are on the dance floor. Thankfully, the guests are shy and are willing to be ordered to dance with other guests they like. The Chef knows which guests each person is willing to dance with and his goal is to have, at any moment in time, the maximum possible number of dancing pairs. A pair of guests will only dance if each is interested in dancing with the other.To complicate matters, each guest may come and go at different parts of the dance.  Specifically, each guest enters the dance only one time, stays for a non-zero length of time, and then leaves the dance and does not return. The Chef is only interested in maximizing the number of dancing pairs at any given moment in time. He is not concerned with repeatedly swapping people to new dance partners, so if a new person enters the dance then the Chef may break up many different dancing couples at this time and form new pairs to maximize the number of dancing pairs.Say B is the total number of boys on the guest list and G is the total number of girls on the guest list. Your goal is the following. For each integer m between 0 and min(B,G), you should determine the total time that the maximum number of couples that the Chef can assign to the dance floor is m.InputThe first line contains a single positive integer T ≤ 30 describing the number of test cases. Each test case begins with three positive integers B, G, and L. B is the number of boys that will attend the dance and G is the number of girls. L indicates the length of the dance.B lines then follow, each describing a boy. Each such line begins with three integers S,T,N where 0 ≤ S < T ≤ L and 0 ≤ N ≤ G. Here, S is number of seconds after the dance starts that the boy enters and T is the number of seconds after the dance starts when the boy leaves. Then N distinct integers between 0 and G-1 follow on the same line that describe the girls that the boy is interested in dancing with.Then G lines follow, each describe a girl in the same manner. The only difference is that 0 ≤ N ≤ B and the last N integers on a line corresponding to a girl are distinct integers between 0 and B-1 describing the boys that the girl is interested in dancing with.Bounds: Both B and G are integers between 1 and 200 and L is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000.OutputYou should output a single line for each test case consisting of min(G,B)+1 integers separated by a single space. Starting at index m = 0, the m'th such integer denotes the total time that the maximum number of dancing pairs that can be formed is m. Notice that the sum of the numbers on the output line should be exactly L.Recall that a pair between a particular boy and a particular girl can only be formed at a given moment of time if both are present at that time and each is interested in dancing with the other.ExampleInput:42 3 100 10 2 0 11 6 3 0 2 14 5 2 0 13 8 1 12 8 1 03 3 200 12 3 0 1 21 13 3 0 1 22 14 3 0 1 23 15 3 0 1 24 16 3 0 1 25 17 3 0 1 24 3 400 17 3 0 1 35 34 2 2 321 40 3 0 1 21 35 2 3 10 27 2 0 311 40 4 0 1 2 35 29 3 0 2 11 1 100 5 1 05 10 1 0Output:7 2 19 2 2 70 16 18 610 0Test Case AnnotationFor the first test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 7, the total time with m = 1 is 2, and the total time with m = 2 is 1.For the second test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 9, the total time with m = 1 is 2, and the total time with m = 2 is 2.For the third test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 0, the total time with m = 1 is 16, and the total time with m = 2 is 18.For the fourth test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 10, the total time with m = 1 is 0, and the total time with m = 2 is 6.For the fifth test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 10, the total time with m = 1 is 0, and the total time with m = 2 is 6.For the sixth test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 10, the total time with m = 1 is 0, and the total time with m = 2 is 6.For the seventh test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 10, the total time with m = 1 is 0, and the total time with m = 2 is 6.For the eighth test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the total time with m = 0 is 10, the total time with m = 1 is 0, and the total time with m = 2 is 6.For the ninth test case, we have:From time 0 to 3, no pairs can be formed.From time 3 to 4, one pair can be formed.From time 4 to 5, two pairs can be formed.From time 5 to 6, one pair can be formed.From time 6 to 10, no pairs can be formed.So, the tota\n","51 ng;\toffering her to buy 'K' gifts.

Two ways are considered to be different if there exists an integer j such that the location of Bob after j steps is different.Sounds like a well known problem? Right!! Bob quickly came up with a perfect solution.A valid path should contain '.' which represent a clean coordinate or '#' which represents a dirty coordinate.If the length of the path is LEN, then Bob's program calculates and prints number of ways to reach (LEN-1, 0) from (0, 0).An integer X is considered to be a good integer if Bob's program prints X for some valid path.You have to write a program to output Y, where Y is N^th good number in the range L to R. You should also print the valid path that would make Bob's program output Y.If there are multiple valid paths, you can output any of them. Please see the output section for more details.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Only line of each test case contains 3 integers L, R and N.OutputFor each test case, output the N ^th good number, followed by space, followed by a valid path.

For every pair of such items (may or may not be of similar type), there is an associated point, which may be different for different pairs. After billing, the computer calculates the maximum reward point that the customer can get by suitably pairing the items (upto 7) marked by the customer. Only two items of a particular type will be considered for reward scheme. There is no reward point for more than two items procured of a particular type. Calculate the maximum reward points that a customer can get after he has purchased a few items and marked the ones for which he/she wants reward points.For example, suppose, n=4 and the pairwise reward metrics are as follows....Type-1Type-2Type-3Type-4Type-15560425Type-260457523Type-34757832Type-425233215Now, if the customer has purchased 2 items each of type 1 and 2 and 4 items of time 3, and has marked 1, 2, 3 as the items on which he/she wants the reward points, the pairing should be (2,3) => 75, (3,2) => 75 and (1,1) => 55 giving a total of 205 points.

The second line is an array of 10 bits corresponding to the 10 different item types. A bit being ‘1’ indicates that the customer wants a reward on that item, a ‘0’ indicates that the customer does not want reward on the item. There will be at-most 7 '1's in this array.

Therefore, optimizing the traveling plan for him is far from an easy task.Let's consider the bus system with N bus stations (numbered from 1 to N) and M buses (numbered from 1 to M). Each bus is represented by 4 integer numbers U, V, S, E which means it will start at the bus station U at the time S and arrive at the bus station V at the time E with no intermediate bus stations. If passenger arrives at the bus station U at the time X ≤ S, he has to wait for S − X units of time to catch this bus. Note, that if he arrives at the bus station U exactly at time S he can catch this bus with no waiting time.The Chef starts at the time 0 in the bus station 1, and he wants to arrive at the bus station N in a way that the longest period that he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible. Besides, he must be at the bus station N before or at the time T for a specially important meeting. Note, that he may wait for a meeting if he arrives at the bus station N early but that period is not our concern here, since he doesn't wait for any bus at that time.InputThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, T and M, denoting the number of bus stations, the deadline for coming to bus station N and the number of buses, respectively.

So he decided to build a restaurant in the Ukrainian resort Bukovel (Carpathian Mountains). But there are many places to choose, so he wants to choose the best one.By your great helps, Chef could find to the best place to build a restaurant, now Chef becomes rich. Now he wants to build a restaurant in the next mountain. Similar to previous one, the next mountain is described by a sequence of N points. Here the points are numbered from 1 to N, and the height of point k is denoted by Hk. Every two adjacent points of the mountain are connected by a segment.For example, the mountain described by N = 9, H = [0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0]  is like a following:       /  ///   /        / In the mountain, all of the tourists will go from the point 1 to point N.For comfort of the tourists, Chef has bought teleports too. Using a teleport, a tourist can be transferred from point i to point j, for all i < j. Of course, tourists can also walk from point i to point i+1 on foot.Now Chef  wants to calculate the attractiveness of the mountain, as the number of the different climbs. A climb is defined by the nonempty sequence (p1, p1+1), (p2, p2+1), ..., (ps, ps+1) of the moves  on foot , where pk+1 ≤ pk+1 for k = 1, 2, ..., s − 1.Two climbs, say (p1, p1+1), (p2, p2+1), ..., (ps, ps+1) and (q1, q1+1), (q2, q2+1), ..., (qt, qt+1) are different if and only ifs ≠ t orThere exists at least one k such that 1 ≤ k < min(s, t) and Hpk+1 – Hpk ≠ Hqk+1 – Hqk.You are given the array H, find the number of the different climbs that exist on the mountain. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 10^9+9 = 1000000009.InputThe first line of input contains T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the number of points on the mountain.On second line of each test case, there are N space-separated integers H1, H2, ..., HN, denoting the height of each point.OutputFor each test case, output an integer denoting the number of the different climbs modulo 10^9+9 = 1000000009.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 100000, that is, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^52 ≤ N ≤ 1000000, that is, 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6Sum of N over all test cases in one file will be at most 1000000 = 10^6-2000000 ≤ Hk ≤ 2000000, that is, −2 × 10^6 ≤ Hk ≤ 2 × 10^6SampleInput361 2 3 4 5 690 2 1 2 1 3 0 1 070 5 -5 5 -5 4 -4Output519955ExplanationIn the first test case, since height increases by one for each move on foot, there will be one unique climb for each length. So there are 5 climbs with length 1, 2, ..., 5. Here length means the number of moves by foot.We can get  the following 5 distinct climbs. (1, 2)(1, 2), (2, 3)(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)The second test case is taken from the problem statement.Warning: The input and output can be large.

Lucy is also a member of the staff and among all the things that the staff want to do, her assignment is to arrange the flowers on the tables.Generally, there are 26 kinds of flowers, a small latin letter corresponds to a single kind. Equal letters correspond to equal kinds. Different letters correspond to different kinds. According to the old ChefLand tradition, one can make a bouquet from some flowers only if it is a substring of some magic string T. ChefLands make bouquets in such a manner that the order of flowers in them is important. The restaurant has a tradition to decorate a single table with N, not necessary different, bouquets. Their order matters.Some decorations look really similar. Generally, two arrangements (let's call them A and B) are similar if B is a cyclic shift of A, or B is a reversed cyclic shift of A. For example the sequence (\"aba\", \"c\", \"b\") is a cyclic shift of a sequence (\"b\", \"aba\", \"c\"), and the sequence (\"c\", \"b\", \"a\", \"e\", \"d\") is a reversed cyclic shift of a sequence (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\").Now Lucy thinks that the most beautiful bouquets are \"symmetric\" ones. The bouquet is \"symmetric\" if the string that corresponds to the arrangement of flowers in it is a palindrome (it reads from left to right the same as from right to left). So, she thinks that the decoration of the table will be especially beautiful if all the bouquets in it are \"symmetric\". But then, Lucy had realized that the number of such decorations of the tables can be less than the number of guests. She doesn't want to decorate two tables in a similar manner, so she would like to know the number of distinct  decorations such that no two tables looks similar.InputThe first line of input consists of a single string T.The second line of input consists of a single integer N.OutputOutput the number of distinct decorations.Constraints1 ≤ |T| ≤ 100000;1 ≤ N ≤ 600;String T consists only of lowercase English letters.ExampleInput:aba4Output:21**Answer:**<string_manipulation>, The problem requires manipulating strings to determine the number of distinct bouquets.**Explanation:**The problem involves working with strings, specifically identifying and counting distinct arrangements of flowers. This requires string manipulation skills, including:* **String comparison:** Comparing strings to determine if they are similar (cyclic shifts or reversed cyclic shifts).* **Palindrome detection:** Identifying if a string is a palindrome.* **String manipulation:**  Possibly using string slicing, concatenation, or other string operations to analyze the arrangements.Let me know if you'd like to \n","82 d(k, 5) ≥ d(k, 3) and d(k, i) = 0 for all i = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9,where d(k, i) denotes the number of the digit i in the decimal representation of the integer k.For example, the first few Ciel numbers are 8, 58, 85, 88, 358, 385, 538, 583, 588, 835, 853, 858, 885, 888, ....Now Tomya defines the x-pseudo Ciel numbers as follows for non-negative integers x:A positive integer k is a 0-pseudo Ciel numbers if and only if k is a Ciel number.For x ≥ 1, a positive integer k is a x-pseudo Ciel numbers if and only ifk is not a y-pseudo Ciel number for all 0 ≤ y < xand, there exists a (x-1)-pseudo Ciel number s such that s have the same number of digits as kand exactly one digit differ from k in their decimal notations.For example,583, 58588, 355388, and 5358388 are 0-pseudo Ciel numbers, and523, 58558, 355308, and 5354388 are 1-pseudo Ciel numbers, and123, 55558, 353308, and 5314388 are 2-pseudo Ciel numbers, and124, 55555, 333308, and 1314388 are 3-pseudo Ciel numbers.In this problem, your task is to find the largest x-pseudo Ciel number less than or equal to N.InputThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.Then T test cases follow.Each test case contains 2 integers x and N in one line.OutputFor each test case, print the largest x-pseudo Ciel number less than or equal to N.If there are no such numbers, print \"-1\" (excluding quotes).Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 (10^4)0 ≤ x ≤ 1000000000 (10^9)1 ≤ N < 10^100000The sum of the length of N in one judge input file does not exceed 1000000 (10^6).Sample Input50 586002 1281 53543891 12 1Sample Output5858812853543881-1**Please provide the skill and reason for the question.**```python# skill:  number_theory, reason: The problem involves understanding and applying concepts related to number theory, \n","83 his scheme Chef fired lift boy and simplifies the process of allocating guests drastically. Now at the time of check-in each guest only provides the preferable room for him and the number of minutes he will stay in the hotel. After that the hotel manager finds the first available room starting from the provided one assuming that rooms in the hotel are arranged in cyclic manner.Namely, let there be R rooms in the hotel and they are numbered by numbers from 0 to R − 1, inclusive. Suppose guest chooses the room K. Then the hotel manager checks rooms in orderK, K + 1, K + 2, ..., R − 2, R − 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., K − 2, K − 1 and allocates the guest in the first free room in this list or report the guest that all rooms are occupied if this is the case.Chef has a logbook where hotel manager writes down information about each guest. Namely, he records the visit time, the preferable room for the guest (NOT the actual room where guest will live), the staying time and the inconvenience caused to the guest, which equals to the number of occupied rooms that hotel manager checks in the list above before allocating the guest (or R if all rooms are occupied). The visit time is provided in minutes after the moment when hotel was opened for visits. Before the first visit all rooms in the hotel were free. When guest leaves the room it could be occupied at the same moment of time by another guest if exactly at this moment the visit occurs.But lift boy prepared the revenge to the Chef. Just before the inspection of the hotel he has erased the second and the third entry of each visit in the logbook (that is, the preferable room and staying time for each guest). Chef needs to recover the damage quickly since only a few hours left before inspector visit. He knows about your advanced skills in programming and asks you for help. He will be satisfied by any consistent recover of the data. That is, if inspector will reproduce the process of allocating guests using the visit time, the preferable room and the staying time for each guest, he will obtain the correct value of the inconvenience caused to each guest.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers R and N, denoting the number of rooms and the number of visits respectively. The description of N damaged records in logbook follows. Namely, each of the following N lines contains 2 space separated integers time and inconv, denoting the time of the visit and inconvenience caused to the guest.OutputFor each test case output N lines. The i-th line among them should contain two space separated integers room and stay_time, the room chosen by the i-th guest and the time he will stay in the hotel, room should be from 0 to R − 1 inclusive and stay_time should be from 1 to 31415926, inclusive. If there are several possible answers you can output any of them. But your output should be consistent as stated above. Existence of such answer is always guaranteed for our test data (see Constraints section below).Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 3141591 ≤ R ≤ 3141591 ≤ N ≤ 3141590 ≤ time < 314159260 ≤ inconv ≤ RThe sum of R over the input does not exceed 314159The sum of N over the input does not exceed 314159Visit times will be given in strictly increasing orderIt is guaranteed that records in logbook could be recovered consistently.Note that time is strictly less than 31415926. It is quite important.ExampleInput:31 20 0314 05 33 031 1314 02 30 01 02 2Output:0 310 314154 314 3142 31410 31 30 31415ExplanationExample case 1. Here R = 1 and N = 2. Let's check that provided output is consistent. The first guest comes at time 0 and asks for room 0 for 31 minutes. Since the hotel is initially empty we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience. The second guest comes at time 314 and asks for room 0 for 31415 minutes. The first guest made this room free at time 31 so at time 314 it is free and we settle the second guest at room 0 causing zero inconvenience.Example case 2. Here R = 5 and N = 3. Again let's check that provided output is consistent. The first guest comes at time 3 and asks for room 4 for 31 minutes. Since the hotel is initially empty we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience. The second guest comes at time 31 and asks for room 4 for 314 minutes. But the first guest is still living in this room (he will free it at time 34). Therefore, we settle the second guest at the room 0 (the next after 4 in cyclic manner) causing inconvenience 1. Finally the third guest comes at time 314 and asks for room 2 for 3141 minutes. This room is free and we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience.Example case 3. Here R = 2 and N = 3. And again let's check that provided output is consistent. The first guest comes at time 0 and asks for room 0 for 3 minutes. Since the hotel is initially empty we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience. The second guest comes at time 1 and asks for room 1 for 3 minutes. This room is free and we settle him at this room causing zero inconvenience. The third guest comes at time 2 and asks for room 0 for 31415 minutes. But both rooms in the hotel are occupied (room 0 will be free at time 3 and room 1 will be free at time 4). Hence we do not settle this guest in any room causing him inconvenience 2. Note that stay time of such a guest actually doesn't matter. You could output any number from 1 to 31415926, inclusive, instead of 31415.**Ski\n","84 ng zeros.

This is because the part 298299300301 doesn't contain any integer completely in it - neither 299, nor 300. But the part 928929930931932 contains the integer 930 completely.**My understanding:**The problem asks for the position of the first occurrence of a string S within a concatenated string D. The string D is formed by concatenating the decimal representations of all positive integers. The constraint is that at least one integer in D must be entirely contained within S.**Skill required:*** **string_manipulation**:  The problem requires manipulating strings, including concatenating them, finding substrings, and checking for the presence of specific characters.**Code:**```pythondef find_position(S, D):    MOD = 10**9 + 7    n = len(S)    for i in range(len(D)):        if S in D[i:i + n]:            return i + 1    return -1# Example usageT = int(input())for _ in range(T):    S = input()    D = str(sum(int(x) for x in str(i) if x.isdigit() and i < 1000000000 for i in range(1, 1000000000)))    print(find_position(S, D))```**Explanation:**The code iterates through the string D and checks if the string S is present within the substring of D starting from index i to i + n. If S is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of S in D. If S is not found, the function returns -1.**Note:**The code assu\n","85 ot necessary distinct.

Arigeom beats, as the name suggests, is a combination of two series of beats. One of them has all its frequencies in arithmetic progression while the other series of beats has all its frequencies in geometric progression.A series of beats is represented by a beat notation, which is the sequence of the frequencies at which the beats are played.To play Arigeom beats, two digital musical instruments are played simultaneously in front of an instrument known as Sono Phone. One instrument plays the beats in arithmetic progression while the other instrument plays the beats in geometric progression. Sono Phone will capture the beats played by each of the two instruments and process them into Arigeom beats. It will merge the beats, sort the beats in ascending order, and remove duplicate beats.For example, suppose one instruments plays the following beats notation: (2, 5, 8, 11), an arithmetic progression, while the other plays (2, 4, 8, 16), a geometric progression. The resulting Arigeom beat notation recorded by Sono Phone will be (2, 4, 5, 8, 11, 16).Because Joe knows how to play Arigeom beats, owns the instruments, and has his friend Chef with him as well, he can't wait anymore to play the beats. Joe has an Arigeom beat notation from his music book and decides that he would play the beats in arithmetic progression while Chef will play the beats in geometric progression. The beat notation consists of N beat frequencies F1, F2, ..., FN. However, he is now confused as to which subset of the beats has to be played by Chef and which one by himself.Help Joe and Chef figure out the subsets of beats to be played by Joe and Chef.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. For each test case, the first line contains an integer N. The second line contains N space-separated integers F1, F2, ..., FN.OutputFor each test case, output two lines. The first line contain the beat notation to be played by Joe (in arithmetic progression). The second line contain the beat notation to be played by Chef (in geometric progression). Each beat notation must contain at least two beats. The beats in each beat notation must be sorted in ascending order.If there are more than one possible pair of beat notations, output any one of them.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 10,000 1 ≤ Fi ≤ 100,000F1 < F2 < ... < FNIt is guaranteed that at least one pair of valid beat notations exists.ExampleInput:462 4 5 8 11 1651 2 3 4 581 3 9 10 19 27 28 8161 4 7 10 13 25Output:2 5 8 112 4 8 161 2 3 4 51 2 41 10 19 281 3 9 27 811 7 134 10 25NoteIn last example, the common ratio is 2.5 (non-integer) even when all the elements of geometric progression sequence are integers.**Solution**```pythondef solve(N, F):    # ...

With the help of these data along with the advanced technologies Aliens had initiated a project called It's The End to get rid of the human beings and occupy the Earth.\"Stupid humans! How could they allow this again?!\" Chef Po has thought and started connecting to the Aliens Data Center to save the Earth again.The first thing he noticed is that there are N servers in the Aliens Data Center and they are arranged in a line. Aliens have rearranged the Data Center to avoid \"Grid Hacking Mechanism\" (refer to this, but this is not needed to understand this problem). Denote the i-th server as Server[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N).Aliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N parts denoted as F[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and placed the part F[i] at the Server[i]. Each server has a password - a non-negative integer. Chef Po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the Data File.The Aliens are really strange beings, so they single out two types of passwords:Power Password - a number of the form A^B (A, B ≥ 2). The list of Power Passwords starts with 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, ...Non-Power Password - any other number. This list starts with 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, ...For simplicity we shall call server secured by a Power Password as Power Server and the server secured by a Non-Power Password as Non-Power Server.All Non-Power Servers have a friendly screen with the color indicator. Suppose you enter a password trying to guess the actual password of such a server. The indicator will then become green if you enter a number which is smaller than the actual password; it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password, or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct.On the other hand, each Power Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all Power Passwords until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of Power Passwords in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password.After the last adventure with Aliens, Chef became smarter so he will use binary search to crack Non-Power Servers. Namely, let A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4], ... be the sequence of all Non-Power Passwords. At first he will try passwords A[2], A[4], A[8], A[16], ... until he either reaches the correct one or the indicator becomes red for the first time. If indicator becomes red at the password A[2] = 1 then he enters A[1] = 0 at the next step and cracks the server (since 0 is the only Non-Power Password less than 1). Let the indicator becomes red at the password A[2^k] where k ≥ 2 while for the password A[2^k−1] indicator was green. Then Chef sets L = 2^k−1, R = 2^k and uses usual binary search to crack the server after that. Namely, at each step he sets M = (L + R) div 2 and checks the password A[M]. If it is correct he finishes the process; if indicator becomes green he sets L = M and continue the process; finally, if indicator becomes red he sets R = M and continue the process.Let's consider some examples:Suppose the password is 9. It's a Power Password, so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a Power Server. Hence he will try the password 4, then 8 and then 9, making 3 tries in all.Suppose the password is 0. It's a Non-Power Password, so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a Non-Power Server. Hence he will try the passwords A[2] = 1, A[1] = 0 in order, making 2 tries in all.Suppose the password is 7. It's a Non-Power Password. Hence he will try the passwords A[2] = 1, A[4] = 3, A[8] = 10, A[6] = 6, A[7] = 7 in order, making 5 tries in all.Suppose the password is 1. It's a Non-Power Password. He will crack this server from the first try since A[2] = 1.You are the secret Aliens agent that got to know about Chef's plan. Your first goal is to estimate the time Chef will spend on cracking each server so that Aliens headquarters would know how much time they have to stop the Chef. Chef spent one second to enter each password.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of servers in the Aliens Data Center. The second line contains N space separated integers. The i-th number among them denotes the password at the Server[i].OutputOutput a single line containing N space separated integers. The i-th number among them should equal to the number of tries Chef will use to crack the Server[i].Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 3141590 ≤ each password ≤ 3141^5Chef Po does not know this bound on the password and assumes that password can be any non-negative integer when he is crackingExampleInput:69 0 7 1 314 100Output:3 2 5 1 15 12ExplanationThe cracking process of first 4 servers explained in the problem statement.**Please provide the skill and reason for the problem.**```pythonskill, reason = \"data_structure\", \"The problem involves understanding and utilizi\n","89 card string T is said to generate a string P if and only if P can be obtained from T by replacing all the asterisks with arbitrary (possibly empty) lowercase Latin letter strings.Consider the i^th symbol of the string S.

The string ab can be obtained if we replace all the asterisks with empty strings.p2 = 6. The corresponding substring bacab contains acab. The string acab can be obtained if we replace the first asterisk with an empty string, the second one with the string ca and the third one with an empty string.p3 = 6. The corresponding substring acab contains ab. p4 = 6. The corresponding substring cab contains cab. The string cab can be obtained if you replace the first asterisk with c, and the rest with empty strings. p5 = 6. The corresponding substring ab contains ab.p6 = p7 = -1. Neither ba nor a doesn't contain any substring, generated by *a*b*.You may have noted that in the explanation for the second test case, ab is also a correct substring generated by T for some positions, but some other string is listed.

The store offers N packs of these candies, where pack i contains Ai candies.Another reason Emily decided to buy candies is that she is fond of collecting empty candy packs from various parts of the world. That's why she decided to buy exactly M packs and present the friends with the candies and keep the packs for her collection. Emily would also like the total number of candies to be divisible by K so that an equal distribution of candies between friends is possible. Among all possible sets of packs, she would like to buy a set with the smallest possible total number of candies (money is the reason).Your task is to help Emily, of course.InputThe first line of the input file contains an integer T -- the number of test cases (no more than 5).

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Here's why:* **Optimal Substructure:** The problem exhibits optimal substructure. The minimum number of notes required to pay a specific amount is determined by the minimum number of notes required to pay the smaller amounts that contribute to it.* **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem has overlapping subproblems. The calculation of the minimum number of notes for a given amount is dependent on the calculation of the minimum number of notes for smaller amounts.* **Memoization:** Dynamic programming relies on memoization to store the results of subproblems. This helps avoid redundant calculations and improves efficiency.**Dynamic Programming Approach:**1. **Initialization:** Create a table to store the minimum number of notes required for each amount. Initialize the table with the base cases (e.g., minimum notes for 0, 1, 2, ...).2. **Iteration:** Iterate through the amounts, starting from the smallest. For each amount, calculate the minimum number of notes required by considering the minimum number of notes required for the previous amounts.3. **Memoization:** Store the calculated minimum number of notes in the table.4. **Result:** Retrieve the minimum number of notes required for the target amount from the table.By using dynamic programming, we can efficiently solve the problem and find \n","96 t really jealous of it and decided to exact revenge.She has invited Barfi to visit her home next week.

For example, the sequence [A,B,D] is a subsequence of [A,B,C,D,E,F].The bead patterns on the necklaces are not considered circular.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer K denoting the number of necklaces of Barfi.K lines follow. Each of them contains a string made from the characters ‘B’ (representing black bead) and ‘G’ (representing golden bead), with the i^th line denoting Barfi Tai's ith necklace.OutputFor each test case, output a truly beautiful necklace with the minimum number of beads. If there are more than one such necklace, you are allowed to print any of them.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 301 ≤ K ≤ 161 ≤ length of each necklace of Barfi ≤ 8ExampleInput:32BGGB2BGBGG3BGGBBBGBOutput:BGBBGGBBGBBExplanationIn the first example,Devu can give necklace the BGB to Jalebi Bai, as it contains both the Barfi's necklace BG and GB as subsequence.Note that Devu can also give GBG to Jalebi Bai.In the second example,Devu can give the necklace BGGB, as it contains both the Barfi's necklace BGB and GG as subsequence.Note that there are many other possible truly beautiful necklaces of length 4, that Devu can give, e.g. BGBG or GBGB.You are allowed to print any of them.In the third example,Devu can give the necklace BGBB or GBGB. You are print any of them as your answer.**S\n","97  be repeated).  The guests then sit down on a round table with their friends.    The Chef now decides that he would like to play a game. He asks you to pick a random person from your table and have them read their number out loud.  Then, moving clockwise around the table, each person will read out their number.  The goal is to find that set of numbers which forms an increasing subsequence. All people owning these numbers will be eligible for a lucky draw! One of the software developers is very excited about this prospect, and wants to maximize the number of people who are eligible for the lucky draw. So, he decides to write a program that decides who should read their number first so as to maximize the number of people that are eligible for the lucky draw. Can you beat him to it?InputThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 15). Then t test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines:The first line contains a number N, the number of guests invited to the party.The second line contains N numbers a1, a2, ..., an separated by spaces, which are the numbers written on the sheets of paper in clockwise order.OutputFor each test case, print a line containing a single number which is the maximum number of guests that can be eligible for participating the the lucky draw. Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 10000You may assume that each number number on the sheet of paper; ai is randomly generated, i.e. can be with equal probability any number from an interval [0,U], where U is some upper bound (1 ≤ U ≤ 10^6).ExampleInput:320 033 2 164 8 6 1 5 2Output:124Output detailsCase 1: No matter where who reads there number first, just one person is eligible for the lucky draw.Case 2: The person in the last position could read their number first to obtain the sequence 1 3 2. We could then pick 2 sheets with numbers 1 and 2.Case 3: The person in the fourth position could read their number first to obtain the sequence 1 5 2 4 8 6. We could then pick 4 sheets with numbers 1 2 4 6.**Skills:**<skill>, reason: <reason for the skill>```python# Your code here```**Answer:**<skill>, reaso\n","98 he first few digits of the long string P.12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940....Given another string Q, he is wondering whether Q is a substring of the string P.For example, QP, and has been marked in bold above. InputThe first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases.

The goal is to put N queens on the chessboard so that no two queens would be able to attack each other.In Johnny's version of the problem (which he states to be \"much harder\" than the original one), there are K \"blocked\" squares given on the chessboard. The goal is still the same: to put N queens on the chessboard such that no two queens would be able to attack each other. However, there are some differences due to the existence of blocked squares. First, a queen cannot be put on a blocked square. Secondly, two queens are considered to be able to attack each other only if there is no blocked square between them. Finally, there must be exactly one queen on every column of the board. Johnny claims that his program solves the above problem very effectively. He generates some test cases (which his program can solve within minutes) to challenge you. You know the method Johnny used to generate the test case. For a given N, Johnny randomly picks a number K between 1 and N^2/2 with equal probability. After that, Johnny picks K blocked squares on the chess board. Any combinations of K squares can be picked with equal probability. Write a program that can solve Johnny's test cases within seconds.InputThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 5). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:The first line contains two integers N and K (8 ≤ N ≤ 500, 1 ≤ K ≤ N^2/2)Each line in the next K lines contains two integers i, j which are the row and the column number of a blocked square (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N)Each test case's input is separated by a blank line. The rows and the columns of the chessboard are numbered from 1 to N. There is always a solution for each test case.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing N integers a1, a2, ..., aN in which ai is the row number of the queen in column i. Any correct solution will be accepted.ExampleInput18 157 73 17 14 88 36 54 42 18 26 33 77 62 31 26 4Output4 2 7 5 2 4 6 8 3 1 **Skills:**<skill>, reason: <reason for the skill>```**Answer:**<algorithm>, reason: <the algorithm used to solve the problem is a core concept in computer science and is required to solve the problem>```**Explanation:**The provided problem description involves a variation of the classic N-Queens problem with additional constraints.  Here's a breakdown of the skills required and why:* **algorithm:**  The core of the problem is to find a solution to the modified N-Queens problem. This requires a systematic approach to explore possible placements of queens while adhering to the constraints.  The solution involves backtracking, a fundamental algorithm in computer science.Let me know if you'd like a more detailed \n","Skills written to output file.\n","Extracted skills saved to /content/programming_gemma2b.txt\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Paths\n","output_path = \"/content/\"\n","file_path = os.path.join(output_path, \"programming.txt\")\n","output_file = os.path.join(output_path, \"programming_output.txt\")\n","import os\n","# Paths\n","\n","# Placeholder function to process a problem using Gemma\n","def process_with_gemma(problem):\n","    skills = extractor.extract_skills(problem.strip())\n","    return skills\n","\n","# Read the math problems and process them\n","count = 0\n","all_skills = []\n","with open(file_path, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:\n","    for line in file:\n","        if line.strip():  # Ignore empty lines\n","            skills = process_with_gemma(line)\n","            skills.replace('\\n', '').replace('\\\\', '')\n","            skills = skills[len(left):len(skills)-len(right)]  # Apply the slice directly after assignment\n","            all_skills.append(skills)\n","            print(count, skills)\n","            count += 1\n","\n","# After processing all lines, write everything at once\n","with open(output_file, \"a\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as outfile:\n","    if all_skills:\n","        outfile.write(\"\\n\\n\".join(all_skills))  # Adds a newline between skills\n","    print(\"Skills written to output file.\")\n","\n","\n","print(f\"Extracted skills saved to {output_file}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":211},"id":"ADVf4MzUsuLu","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1743020941042,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":42,"user":{"displayName":"Yagol Xu Chen","userId":"00929278906170525619"}},"outputId":"db1dab2f-c4c1-4034-8fd2-799bcc55e12a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"FileNotFoundError","evalue":"[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/content/programming.txt'","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-26-b96544ce4aaf>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     14\u001b[0m \u001b[0mcount\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     15\u001b[0m \u001b[0mall_skills\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 16\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32mwith\u001b[0m \u001b[0mopen\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mfile_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\"r\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mencoding\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"utf-8\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     17\u001b[0m     \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mline\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfile\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     18\u001b[0m         \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0mline\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mstrip\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m  \u001b[0;31m# Ignore empty lines\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/content/programming.txt'"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Specify the file path\n","file_path = 'all_skills.txt'\n","\n","# Open the file in write mode and save the list as a string\n","with open(file_path, 'w') as f:\n","    for skill in all_skills:\n","        f.write(f\"{skill}\\n\")"],"metadata":{"id":"lpjR39YWtn41"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["a = [\"Consider this question.
